# EPFL STI interdisciplinary robot competition 2016 - Group 3
This repo contains code developed for the EPFL 2016 STI interdisciplinary robot competition, by group 3 ('Made In China`): Vardi Adi, Thomas Sean and Kji Houda.

The purpose of this competition is to build a working robot, capable of collecting 0.5L PET bottles and deposing them in a deposition zone. The work is done in groups of three, from different faculties and backgrounds. This aims to introduce students into working in heterogeneous groups, in collaboration and to develop soft skills, such as project, group and budget management, aside from the technical skills.
Each group has to come up with ideas, design and manufacture their own robot. The robot must be able to move, detect and pick up bottles and deposit them in a predefined zone. Each robot is limited to 10 minutes, and is scored based on its performance in this time. The arena is semi predefined, with different zones of varying difficulty. The robot can use any method, but must be completely autonomous with no part being off-board.

As we all have different skills and knowledge, each of us led a different aspect of the robot design, such as mechanics, electronics, low level and high level software. However, as we are all interested in learning new skills, our work was interactive and collaborative.


**Note:** The code in this repo is presented as developed, by 3 young students under tight time limits. It has not been cleaned or arranged.
